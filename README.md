Hostel Feedback Classifier
This project, the Hostel Feedback Classifier, is designed to streamline the process of managing student feedback by automatically categorizing issues reported by hostel residents. The primary goal is to efficiently route feedback to the appropriate department, enabling quicker resolution and better identification of recurring problems across various operational areas.

Project Overview
The classifier takes raw student feedback as input and intelligently assigns it to one of several predefined departments:

Facility

Hostel

Academics

IT Service

Labs

Administration

Crucially, it also includes an Uncategorized label for feedback that does not clearly fit into any of the established categories, ensuring no feedback is lost and allowing for manual review of ambiguous cases. This automated classification helps in prioritizing and delegating tasks, improving overall administrative efficiency and student satisfaction.

Technologies Used
The development and functionality of this classifier leverage a robust set of tools and techniques:

IDE / Platform: Google Colab

Foundation Model: FLAN-T5 Base (google/flan-t5-base)

Libraries: transformers, pandas

File Handling: CSV upload/download via google.colab.files

NLP Technique: Few-shot prompting with instruction tuning

Post-processing: Keyword-based fallback classification

Optional Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn (for future enhancements)

This combination allows for effective natural language processing, data management, and the potential for insightful data visualization.
